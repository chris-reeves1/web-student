Lab 1 — HTML Basics: Repair + Extend a Mini Site
------------------------------------------------

Outcome
-------
By the end of this lab you will be able to:
- Correct broken HTML structure and improve semantic layout
- Create a basic multi-page site (Home, About, Contact)
- Build a valid HTML table using thead and tbody
- Use correct relative paths for links and images
- Apply basic accessibility practices

What you start with:
You are given one file: broken.html

Your job:
- Make the page render cleanly and consistently in 
  the browser (no weird layout, missing content, or broken links).
- Make the site navigable by creating the missing pages and fixing the navigation.
- Extend the page by adding two new sections (Customers Preview + Contact).

Step 0 — Setup:
- Create a folder called lab1/
- Put broken.html inside it.
- Open the folder in VS Code.
- Use Live Server to test as you go.

Part 1 — Repair (use the browser + your eyes)
- Open broken.html in the browser and do a repair pass.

Rules:
- Do not change the “theme” of the page.
- You may rearrange elements if the structure is clearly wrong.
- Test after each fix.

Quality targets:
- Navigation should go to real pages.
- Image should be meaningful and accessible.
- Table should be structured properly (header and body).
- The page should have a sensible semantic structure.

Part 2 — Extend (Add two new sections)
After the page is repaired, add:
- A) Customers:
        Add a new section under “Product List” called Customers containing:
            a short paragraph saying it is sample data
            a 3-row table with columns:
                Customer ID
                Company Name
                Country

- B) Contact:
Add a section called Contact containing:
- an email link using mailto:
- a phone number (plain text)

Part 3 — Create missing pages:
- Create a new page called about.html in the same folder.
- It must:
    - reuse the same layout structure (header + nav + main + footer)
    - include:
        one paragraph describing the site purpose
        one list of 5 features
        one image with correct alternative text
        be linked from the nav with correct relative paths

Also create contact.html (a simple page is fine for now — forms come later).
