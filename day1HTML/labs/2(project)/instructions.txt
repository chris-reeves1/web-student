Build the three-page mini-site (index.html, about.html, contact.html) by 
recreating the screenshots using semantic HTML (header/nav/main/footer), 
valid boilerplate (doctype, lang, charset, viewport), and working relative 
links between pages. 

Use tables with proper structure (caption, thead, tbody, th scope="col") and a 
contact form with correctly linked labels and basic validation. 

You may choose any IDs/structure you like for Day 1/2 because this is 
HTML/CSS practice — however we will all use the same startting code for JS labs.
