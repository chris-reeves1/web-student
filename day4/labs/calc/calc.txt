Student Brief — Mini Project: Online Calculator (HTML + CSS + JS)
Goal

Build a working “Online Calculator” web page that:

takes two numbers

lets the user choose an operator (+, −, ×, ÷)

shows the result on the page when the user clicks Calculate

handles invalid input and division by zero safely

This project is about the core web workflow:
HTML hooks → JS selects elements → event listener → read/validate/compute → update DOM.

Deliverables

Create a folder called calculator/ containing:

index.html

styles.css

script.js

When opened in a browser, the calculator should work with no errors in the console.

Constraints (important)

No inline JS (no onclick="" in HTML)

JS must be in script.js and loaded with a <script src="script.js"></script> tag

Use the given IDs exactly (firstNumber, secondNumber, operator, calculate, result)

Output must update by changing textContent of the result paragraph

Step-by-step instructions
Step 1 — Create the HTML structure (index.html)

Create the basic page structure (<!DOCTYPE html>, <head>, <body>).

Add a container <div class="container">.

Inside it, add:

<h1>Online Calculator</h1>

first <input type="number" id="firstNumber">

<select id="operator"> with options +, -, *, /

second <input type="number" id="secondNumber">

<button id="calculate">Calculate</button>

<p id="result">Result will be displayed here</p>

Link your CSS in the <head>:

<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css" />

Load your JS at the end of <body>:

<script src="script.js"></script>

✅ Checkpoint: Page loads and shows form controls, even if it doesn’t “calculate” yet.

Step 2 — Style the page (styles.css)

Your aim:

centre the calculator on the page

make it look like a card

give inputs consistent padding and spacing

make the button look clickable

make the result area visible

✅ Checkpoint: Your calculator is centred, readable, and looks like a UI—not raw HTML.

Step 3 — Wire up DOM hooks (script.js)

In script.js, your first job is to select the elements you need (DOM hooks):

first number input

second number input

operator select

calculate button

result paragraph

✅ Checkpoint: console.log(...) each variable and confirm it prints the element (not null).

Step 4 — Add the event listener

Your calculator should only run when the user clicks Calculate.

Add a "click" event listener to the button.

When clicked, call a function called calculate().

✅ Checkpoint: Clicking the button triggers your handler (prove it with a console.log("clicked")).

Step 5 — Implement calculate(): read → validate → compute → write

Inside calculate():

A) Read values

Read firstNumberInput.value and secondNumberInput.value

Convert them to numbers using parseFloat(...)

B) Validate inputs

If either number is NaN → show:

"Please enter a valid number"

then return

C) Compute using the operator

Use switch (operator):

+ → add

- → subtract

* → multiply

/ → divide

but if second number is 0, show:

"Division by zero is not allowed"

then return

D) Write result back to the DOM

Update the paragraph:

resultParagraph.textContent = "Result: " + result;

✅ Checkpoint: You can calculate 5+5, 10-3, 4*6, 10/2 correctly.

Required behaviour tests (you must pass these)

Valid numbers

2 + 3 → Result: 5

10 / 4 → Result: 2.5

Invalid input

leave one blank → shows “Please enter a valid number”

Division by zero

10 / 0 → shows “Division by zero is not allowed”

No console errors

Open DevTools → Console must be clean (no red errors)
