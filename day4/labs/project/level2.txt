Level 2 — Real-World Guided (more structured, cleaner)

What you are building:
Same outcome as Level 1, but with clean structure:
    A state object for query
    No innerHTML += inside loops (prefer DOM creation)
    Clear separation:
        getFilteredCustomers()
        renderCustomers(customers)
        updateCounter(shown, total)

Definition of Done:
Everything in Level 1 plus:
    No code duplication (counter update is in one function)
    Search does not break if customer fields are missing (use String(x || ""))

Suggested approach:

const state = { query: "" };
On input, update state.query, then:
    const filtered = getFilteredCustomers();
    renderCustomers(filtered);
    updateCounter(filtered.length, CUSTOMERS.length);
