Day 3 (JavaScript) — Choose Your Level

Goal (everyone):
Use a single in-memory dataset (customers) to:

Render customers into the Customers table
Filter the table using the Search box (live as you type)
Update the counter: X shown out of Y total

No JSON / no AJAX today. Data lives in the JS file.

Your HTML must already contain these IDs (it will if you use day 2 soultion index.html)
customerSearch (the search <input>)
customerCounter (the counter <p>)
customersTbody (the <tbody> you will fill)
